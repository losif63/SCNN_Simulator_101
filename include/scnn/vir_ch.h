*  Crossbars have many input channels & output channels,
*  and every combination of input and output channels are connected.
*  The Xbar class consists of two VirtualChannel objects - 1 for input,
*  and 1 for output.
*  Thus, this VirtualChannel class connects many physical channels with 
*  1 channel.
